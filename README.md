# ci-workflows-trader
ci-workflows-trader is a project to calculate GHActions CI workflows

Unlike other CI servers, GitHub Actions can define several workflows that can be responsible for executing tasks not related to CI. *“A workflow is an automated process composed of a series of jobs that gets executed when it’s triggered by an event. Workflows are defined in YAML files and are stored in a .github/workflows directory at the root of the repository. A repository can also have multiple workflows”* [4]. 
Therefore, it was necessary to select workflows related to CI.

We considered a workflow to be a CI-related workflow when:

**Direct Identification**: The workflow file contains “CI” in the name of the YAML file, example: “ci.yml” or “\*-ci.yml”, or contains “CI” in the workflow name, for example: “name: Node.js CI”

**Indirect Identification**: In this case, we identified workflows related to CI by the file content using three criteria: 

 * **(i)** checking if the workflow has the action “action/checkout”, as it is the most frequently used action in CI workflows [10].
            
 * **(ii)** Check if the workflow has the event “push” or “pull_request”, as they are the most frequent events [10].
            
 * **(iii)** checking if the file has one of the 30 most common CI-related keywords in workflow file metadata. To find the most common CI-related keywords, we downloaded the content of all workflows files directly identified as CI workflow, tokenized it, and manually identified the 30 most common tokens related to CI.
